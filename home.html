        <h2>Airline Ticket Booking</h2>
        
        <p>Airline reservation systems are systems that allow an airline to sell their inventory. It contains information on schedules and fares and contains a database of reservations and of tickets issued. ARSs are part of passenger service systems, which are applications supporting the direct contact with the passenger.<br><br>ARS eventually evolved into the computer reservations system (CRS). A computer reservation system is used for the reservations of a particular airline and interfaces with a global distribution system (GDS) which supports travel agencies and other distribution channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a single system.

        <h4>How does the airline reservation system works....</h4>The world of airline reservations is a rather complex business. With carriers almost constantly processing bookings from expectant passengers, they need a means of keeping on top of everything. How this is done has changed a lot over the years, as technological advances such as the advent of computers have allowed airlines to move away from manual systems.<br>
        <h4>How reservation systems work today.....</h4>Modern airline reservation systems allow passengers to directly make their bookings on their chosen airlineâ€™s website. They store information like schedules, booking class rules, and fares/tariffs, which helps in making dynamic pricing possible. Meanwhile, global distribution systems are the mid-point between travel agents and service providers.
